Designing Distributed Systems: Patterns and Paradigms for Scalable, Reliable Systems Using Kubernetes 2nd Edition - Brendan Burns

Review: 4/5

Overall, this book sets a good foundation for distributed systems. It explains several patterns and provides working examples and diagrams for each.

My main gripe with the book is the random AI section at the end. Chapter 15 talks about setting up AI models as part of a distributed system. It was jarring to read since most of the book focused on general patterns that would apply to any scenario, but dedicated one chapter to AI as it's own type of service. However, deployment of AI is not very different from deployments of other services, so it didn't feel relevant to the book.

Anyways, worth reading.
